	\section{Introduction to Current Events}
		The very nature of current events makes it extremely hard to write a section of a book on this.  Studying for the current events means keeping up with the news.  Whether it be online news sites like \href{http://www.cnn.com}{CNN's website}, watching the news on TV or even reading the newspaper, you must do this every day to be well informed about current events.  
		
		This section will change quite frequently, and some of the current events section will undoubtedly be moved into the "history" section as time passes.  For reference, this version of the Ultimate QuizBowl Guide was released on \today.
