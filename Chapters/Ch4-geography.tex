		\paragraph{UNESCO World Heritage Sites:} UNESCO world heritage sites are landmarks or areas, selected by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for having cultural, historical, scientific or other form of significance, which is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged to be important for the collective and preservative interests of humanity. In the United States, there are 11 cultural, 12 natural, and 1 mixed sites. 
		
		\begin{longtable}{|c|p{3 in}|p{3in}|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Name and Date Designated} & \textbf{Description\footnote{Descriptions are summarized from UNESCO website, https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/us}} \\
			\hline
			Cultural & Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site (1982) & The largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico.  Primary features at the site include Monks Mound, the largest prehistoric earthwork in the Americas, covering over 5 ha and standing 30 m high.\\
			\hline
			Cultural & Chaco Culture (1987) & Chaco Canyon, a major center of ancestral Pueblo culture between 850 and 1250, was a focus for ceremonials, trade and political activity for the prehistoric Four Corners area. Chaco is remarkable for its monumental public and ceremonial buildings and its distinctive architecture \\
			\hline
			Cultural & Independence Hall (1979) & The Declaration of Independence (1776) and the Constitution of the United States (1787) were both signed in this building in Philadelphia. The universal principles of freedom and democracy set forth in these documents are of fundamental importance to American history and have also had a profound impact on law-makers around the world.\\
			\hline
			Cultural & La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site in Puerto Rico (1983) & Between the 16th and 20th centuries, a series of defensive structures was built at this strategic point in the Caribbean Sea to protect the city and the Bay of San Juan. They represent a fine display of European military architecture adapted to harbour sites on the American continent.\\
			\hline
			Cultural &Mesa Verde National Park (1978) & A great concentration of ancestral Pueblo Indian dwellings, built from the 6th to the 12th century, can be found on the Mesa Verde plateau in south-west Colorado at an altitude of more than 2,600 m. Some 4,400 sites have been recorded, including villages built on the Mesa top. There are also imposing cliff dwellings, built of stone and comprising more than 100 rooms.\\
			\hline
			Cultural & Monticello and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville (1987) & Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826), author of the American Declaration of Independence and third president of the United States, was also a talented architect of neoclassical buildings. He designed Monticello (1769–1809), his plantation home, and his ideal 'academical village' (1817–26), which is still the heart of the University of Virginia. Jefferson's use of an architectural vocabulary based upon classical antiquity symbolizes both the aspirations of the new American republic as the inheritor of European tradition and the cultural experimentation that could be expected as the country matured. \\
			\hline
			Cultural & Monumental Earthworks of Poverty Point (2014) & Monumental Earthworks of Poverty Point owes its name to a 19th-century plantation close to the site, which is in the Lower Mississippi Valley on a slightly elevated and narrow landform. The complex comprises five mounds, six concentric semi-elliptical ridges separated by shallow depressions and a central plaza. It was created and used for residential and ceremonial purposes by a society of hunter fisher-gatherers between 3700 and 3100 BP. It is a remarkable achievement in earthen construction in North America that was unsurpassed for at least 2,000 years.\\
			\hline
			Cultural &San Antonio Missions (2015) & The site encompasses a group of five frontier mission complexes situated along a stretch of the San Antonio River basin in southern Texas, as well as a ranch located 37 kilometres to the south. It includes architectural and archaeological structures, farmlands, residencies, churches and granaries, as well as water distribution systems. The complexes were built by Franciscan missionaries in the 18th century and illustrate the Spanish Crown’s efforts to colonize, evangelize and defend the northern frontier of New Spain. The San Antonio Missions are also an example of the interweaving of Spanish and Coahuiltecan cultures, illustrated by a variety of features, including the decorative elements of churches, which combine Catholic symbols with indigenous designs inspired by nature.\\
			\hline
			Cultural &Statue of Liberty (1984) & Made in Paris by the French sculptor Bartholdi, in collaboration with Gustave Eiffel (who was responsible for the steel framework), this towering monument to liberty was a gift from France on the centenary of American independence. Inaugurated in 1886, the sculpture stands at the entrance to New York Harbour and has welcomed millions of immigrants to the United States ever since.\\
			\hline
			Cultural &Taos Pueblo (1992) & Situated in the valley of a small tributary of the Rio Grande, this adobe settlement – consisting of dwellings and ceremonial buildings – represents the culture of the Pueblo Indians of Arizona and New Mexico. \\
			\hline
			Cultural &The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright (2019) & The property consists of eight buildings in the United States designed by the architect during the first half of the 20th century. These include well known designs such as Fallingwater (Mill Run, Pennsylvania) and the Guggenheim Museum (New York). All the buildings reflect the ‘organic architecture’ developed by Wright, which includes an open plan, a blurring of the boundaries between exterior and interior and the unprecedented use of materials such as steel and concrete. Each of these buildings offers innovative solutions to the needs for housing, worship, work or leisure. Wright's work from this period had a strong impact on the development of modern architecture in Europe.\\

	\section{Oceans}
		Though globally all oceans are connected and currents circulate water through all of the ocean, historically, there have been four named oceans: Atlantic, Arctic, Indian and Pacific. Recently, many countries, including the United States have began recognizing a fifth ocean: the Southern Ocean, which is the large ocean area that encircles Antarctica.
